                Hello! My name is Siew Fen Eow but I preferred being called Angeline! 
                I am currently a senior at UCLA, majoring in Data Theory.
                I have been working on data analysis and creating various data visualization for classes, club and personal projects 
                but I have never experience with map-making. I am fascinated with map-making and interested in using it in my future work.
                My goal as a critical digital map maker is to create maps with the most up-to-date information and raise social awareness.
            </p>
